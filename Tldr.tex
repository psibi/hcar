tldr is a command line client for the TLDR pages. The TLDR pages are a
community effort to simplify the beloved man pages with practical
examples.

Compared to the previous version, the new verion works in Windows and
doesn't do eager cloning. Also default completion support has been
added from optparse-applicative. The new-format branch contains
changes for the new syntax of TLDR pages and will be merged with
master whenever the upstream changes are finalized and merged.
