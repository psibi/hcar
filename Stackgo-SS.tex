A browser plugin (currently supported for Firefox/Google Chrome) to
automatically redirect Haddock documentation on Hackage to
corresponding Stackage pages, when the request is via search engines
like Google/Bing etc. For the case where the package hasn't been added
yet to Stackage, no redirect will be made and the Hackage
documentation will be available. This plugin also tries to guess when
the user would want to go to a Hackage page instead of the Stackage
one and tries to do the right thing there.
