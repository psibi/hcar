A Yesod scaffolding site with Postgres backend. It provides a JSON API backend
as a separate subsite. The primary purpose of this repository is to use Yesod
as a API server backend and do the frontend development using a tool like
React or Angular. The current code includes a basic example using React and
Babel which is bundled finally by webpack and added in the handler
\texttt{getHomeR} in a type safe manner.

The future work is to make it compatible with yesod-1.6 and then integrate
it as part of yesod-scaffold and make it as part of \texttt{stack
  template}.
